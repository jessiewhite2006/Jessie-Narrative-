Once you understand your reference position, you can begin glitching with more precision.   
   
To add your glitch image, simply find and delete the hero.jpg file in the project folder. Then name your glitched image file to the project folder and name it "hero.jpg."

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Jessie White I plan on majoring in Professional Communications on the Digital Media track with a Sports Study Certificate! I am from a small town in Pennslvania called Berwick! I took this class because I want to do social media mangment for the NHL, hopefully the Pittsburgh Penguins, so I want to learn how to compose digital media in a more professional way. The only semi-professional type of digital media I have produced was through Canva, for a Instagram accout I run for book reviews and promoting indie authors. I have also taken photos for the Penguins AHL team.  </p>

<!--Flexbox uses rows and column classes to create layouts that scale content across devices. The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens. Add images to your project folder and make sure the file name/type matches in your code. Resize images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time accessibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->

    <div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Everyday Code</h2>
    <p>After looking at my last five days of what I use on my divices, I was not extremely suprised. When fist looking at it the data looks like I am constantly on my phone but that is not really the case. Whilie my Youtube useage seems abnormally high, only about one hour of that is me activitly watching youtube. Duing the day while doing schoolwork I have video essays on, and I use it as white noise while I am falling asleep so this wracks up qucikly. I have also started playing Township so this is why that is my second highest data. My screen time also takes data from all of my Apple technology, leading again to higher numbers. This is a major way digital media effects my life because it lets me focaus better letting me not hear the noise in the area I am working in.</p>

<!--Take a picture of your data visualization and use it to replace this image. Control image width using inline styling. Adjust frame using class selector on style.css.-->

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Code and digital technology impact on education</h2>
    <p> Digital Technology has has a major impact on my learning experience. The first time I can rember using digital technology in in kindergarden when we use the website StarFall to use edcational games to help us learn things such as counting, months and holidays. Then it became a major part of my Middle and High School experience because most of my work was done online in high school and I used it for homework such as IXL in middle school. It also had a major impact on my education during Covid because it gave me acess to do my school work and continue my learning when I was stuck at home in my room. </p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Moving forward with technology</h2>
    <p>Digital Technology will have a major impact on my future. As stated above after I finish my degree I want to become a social media manger for the NHL. In this carrer I will need to use many forms of digital technology and programs, such as photoshop, lightroom, canva, video editing software and of couse many diffrent forms of social media. Along with this I am going to need to take videos and phots in high shutter speeds to capture the players on the ice to get clear pictures because of how fast they move.</p>
